# POL-013: Data Classification & Handling

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Policy ID** | POL-013 |
| **Version** | 2.0 |
| **Last Reviewed** | 2026-02-06 |
| **Owner** | Security Lead / Data Protection Officer |
| **Approval** | CISO / VP Engineering |

## Objective

Classify all data by sensitivity, apply proportional controls, and prevent data leakage—including leakage through AI coding assistants, logs, error messages, and third-party services.

## Scope

Applies to: all data stored, processed, transmitted, or generated by any system, including data sent to AI coding assistants, third-party APIs, and development tools.

## Mandatory Controls

### CTRL-013.1: Classification Levels

| Level | Label | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **C1** | Public | No impact if disclosed | Marketing content, public docs, open-source code |
| **C2** | Internal | Minor impact if disclosed | Internal wikis, non-sensitive configs, aggregate metrics |
| **C3** | Confidential | Significant impact if disclosed | PII, customer data, API keys, business financials |
| **C4** | Restricted | Severe impact if disclosed | Passwords, encryption keys, PHI, PCI data, trade secrets |

### CTRL-013.2: Handling Rules Per Classification

| Control | C1 Public | C2 Internal | C3 Confidential | C4 Restricted |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------------|---------------|
| **Storage encryption** | Optional | At rest | At rest (AES-256) | At rest + field-level |
| **Transit encryption** | HTTPS | HTTPS | TLS 1.2+ mutual auth | TLS 1.3 + mutual auth |
| **Access control** | None | Role-based | Need-to-know + role-based | Need-to-know + MFA |
| **Logging** | Full | Full | Masked (PII redacted) | Audit log only, no values |
| **Retention** | Indefinite | Per policy | Defined + auto-delete | Minimum necessary + auto-delete |
| **Backup** | Standard | Standard | Encrypted backup | Encrypted + separate key |
| **AI assistant usage** | Allowed | Allowed | Prohibited without redaction | Prohibited absolutely |
| **Dev/test environments** | Real data OK | Real data OK | Synthetic/anonymized only | Synthetic only |
| **Third-party sharing** | Allowed | With NDA | DPA required | Prohibited without legal review |

**Enforcement**: Data classification tags in code (decorators, comments, schema annotations). CI scanner flags unclassified data fields. AI prompt gateway blocks C3/C4 data.

**Evidence artifact**: Data classification inventory, CI scan results.

### CTRL-013.3: Data Classification in Code

Every data model MUST have classification annotations:

```typescript
// TypeScript example
interface User {
  id: string;                    // @data-class: C2
  email: string;                 // @data-class: C3-PII
  name: string;                  // @data-class: C3-PII
  passwordHash: string;          // @data-class: C4
  preferences: Preferences;     // @data-class: C2
  ssn?: string;                  // @data-class: C4-PII
}
```

```python
# Python example
from dataclasses import dataclass, field
from governance.classification import C2, C3, C4

@dataclass
class User:
    id: str = field(metadata={"classification": C2})
    email: str = field(metadata={"classification": C3})
    password_hash: str = field(metadata={"classification": C4})
```

**Enforcement**: Linter rule requires classification annotation on all data model fields. Unclassified fields block PR merge.

**Evidence artifact**: Lint pass showing all fields classified.

### CTRL-013.4: Data Inventory

Maintain a living data inventory:

```markdown
| Data Element | Classification | Storage Location | Retention | Owner | Compliance |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|------------|
| User email | C3-PII | users_db.email | Account lifetime + 30d | Identity team | GDPR Art 6 |
| Payment card | C4-PCI | Stripe (tokenized) | Transaction only | Payments team | PCI-DSS |
| Access logs | C2 | CloudWatch | 90 days | Platform team | SOC2 |
```

**Enforcement**: Quarterly data inventory review. New data stores require inventory update in PR.

**Evidence artifact**: Data inventory document, quarterly review sign-off.

### CTRL-013.5: AI-Specific Data Controls

| Rule | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|
| C3/C4 data MUST NOT be pasted into AI prompts | AI prompt gateway / developer training |
| C3/C4 data MUST NOT appear in AI-generated code as examples | Code review checklist |
| AI tools with cloud processing MUST NOT process C4 data | Tool configuration, network controls |
| AI-generated test data MUST be synthetic for C3/C4 | Test data review |
| Code snippets sent to AI MUST NOT contain hardcoded secrets | Secret scanner on outbound AI requests |

**Enforcement**: Network-level AI prompt proxy that scans for classified data patterns. Developer training annually.

**Evidence artifact**: AI prompt proxy logs (sampling), training completion records.

### CTRL-013.6: Data Breach Response

If classified data is exposed:

| Classification | Response SLA | Actions |
|---------------|-------------|---------|
| C1 | Acknowledge within 1 week | Review and close |
| C2 | Acknowledge within 48 hours | Assess impact, remediate |
| C3 | Notify Security within 4 hours | Incident response, assess regulatory notification |
| C4 | Notify Security within 1 hour | Full incident response, legal review, regulatory notification |

**Enforcement**: Security incident response process (POL-010). Breach notification automation.

**Evidence artifact**: Incident record, notification records.

---

## Exception Path

1. Data classification downgrade requires Data Owner + Security Lead approval
2. AI usage exception for C3 data requires: data anonymization proof + Security Lead approval
3. C4 data exceptions: CISO approval only, maximum 30-day TTL
4. All exceptions logged in `ai-governance/exceptions-log.md` with compensating controls

## KPI Linkage

| KPI | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Data fields classified | 100% | Classified fields / total fields |
| C3/C4 data in logs | 0 instances | Log scanner findings |
| C3/C4 data sent to AI tools | 0 instances | AI prompt proxy alerts |
| Data inventory freshness | Updated quarterly | Last review date |
| Data breach incidents | 0 | Incident count |
